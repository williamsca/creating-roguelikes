Absence of Rot/Waffle of Twilight is a turn-based rogue-like which takes place
in a decaying garden/typical American breakfast table. The Player-Character (PC),
indicated by the '@' sign, must explore the world, fighting off bugs/weeds //
antagonistic breakfast foods, in order to acquire the levels, items, and companions(?)
necessary to defeat the boss: NEGLIGENT GARDENER/PANCAKE OF DAWN.

Inspirations:
1. Risk of Rain (random skill power-ups)
2. NetHack ('search' command)
3. Crypt of the NecroDancer (intuitive control scheme)
